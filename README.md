> A [CyberDeck](https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberdeck) is a personal mobile computer found in many cyberpunk novels and video games that is used by hackers or "Deckers" to temporarily connect their mind or "jack in" to cyberspace.  Some of the first appearances of CyberDecks were in the Sprawl Trilogy by William Gibson in the early 1980s.

This is a series of lists related to [CyberDecks](https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberdeck), including decks themselves, components, software, and other resources.  This page is meant to be a resource for those who are building their own decks.  The list originaly started as part of the build process of my CyberDeck, the [Y.A.A.C](https://github.com/DayZedAndConfused762/Y.A.A.C), and I figure why keep the research to myself?
