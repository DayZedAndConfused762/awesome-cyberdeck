# Contribution Guidelines

Research if the stuff you're including is actually awesome. Only put stuff on the list that you or another contributor can personally recommend. You should rather leave stuff out than include too much.

I am still learning how to use GitHub, so for now the best way to add to the list is to submit your addition and an issue, in the discussions area, or email [mailto:DayZedAndConfused@gmail.com](DayZedAndConfused@gmail.com).
